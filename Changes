Revision history for Mac-PropertyList-SAX

0.01    2006-06-18T17:25-0500
		First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02	2006-06-19T11:01-500
		Minor changes, including copy-and-paste error fixes and actually
		including the plist files for the tests in the MANIFEST so the whole
		package gets built.

		DOCTYPE declarations in test files were pointing to local paths that do
		not exist on a non-Macintosh system; I changed these local paths to
		http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd. This points out a
		(perhaps unfortunate) consequence of using a real XML parser: it (at
		least by default) needs access to the DTDs, which are usually on the
		Internet.
