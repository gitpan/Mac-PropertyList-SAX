Revision history for Mac-PropertyList-SAX

0.01    2006-06-18T17:25
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

0.02    2006-06-19T11:01
        Minor changes, including copy-and-paste error fixes and actually
        including the plist files for the tests in the MANIFEST so the whole
        package gets built.

        DOCTYPE declarations in test files were pointing to local paths that do
        not exist on a non-Macintosh system; I changed these local paths to
        http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd. This points out a
        (perhaps unfortunate) consequence of using a real XML parser: it (at
        least by default) needs access to the DTDs, which are usually on the
        Internet.

0.04    2006-07-10T12:35
        Itty-bitty little changes, including fixing VERSION in pod, removing an
        unused state enumeration, and fixing tabs and dates in Changes.

0.05    2006-07-20T12:14
        Added pod-coverage test for higher Kwalitee; removed test on XML
        version 0.9, which is not supported by some XML parsers (removing a
        test doesn't seem right, but I can't guarantee that the parser I get
        will support XML 0.9, since I'm using XML::SAX::ParserFactory).

0.06    2007-03-26T22:00
        Updated META.yml to 1.2 spec; fixed version discrepancy between pm and
        META.yml; added license 'perl' to META.yml.
